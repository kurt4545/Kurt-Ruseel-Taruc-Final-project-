				<p >I am Kurt Russel Taruc... And i was a college student in Collegio de Montalban. I  am a Guy who always need some assistance in everyday life because i am no <br> 
					t mentally well. I can cook, i can do house chores, and also i can multi task... But when an anxiety triggers, I need my girlfriend to be with me. Coz it  <br> 
					feels like i'm falling into darkness while drowning, You know? Feels like in an empty cold dark world. But lets take a look at my positive side. I love Arts, <br> 
					 Music, Gaming and Anime... I always love to play games since i was young. And i am true to myself. If you feel i abandoned you or i just using you? Remember  <br> 
					 these words. I'm just not mentally well, i don't want you to feel like that. That's all.</p>
